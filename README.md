# SaveBackup
application; backups files; constantly

Specifically made for P.A.M.E.L.A.'s early access. Hope it works. 
The idea is that you have a game in which you can't manually save, 
and that only generates one or two autosaves. T
hose files can get corrupted. 
You might lose everything. 
Why not spam back-ups every time the savefile changes?
